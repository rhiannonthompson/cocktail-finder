* Create React App (17.0.2)
* React-Router (5.2.0)
* Material-UI (4.11.4)

## Description

Cocktail Finder was designed as an exercise to learn how to call and query an API using React. This application uses [The CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), an open crowed-sourced database, for all the cocktail recipes and images. The front-end was built with modern React, using a hooks-based implementation with the inbuilt context provider for state management. The project uses Material-UI for styling the React components, with a custom theme created for the project. The code for this project this available at: <Link href="https://github.com/rhiannonthompson/cocktail-finder">github.com/rhiannonthompson/cocktail-finder</Link>.
